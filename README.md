# Colton's Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

I created this webpage as a onestop shop for studying what I've learned in the Prework for Full Stack Coding bootcamp.
It was created to not only practice my skills using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Git but to also have something that I can show off and call my own. I wanted it to be simple to read and interact with so that it would be easier for myself and anyone else who might interact with the page to study quickly and easily.
I learned so much through this process and ultimately am thrilled to continue on this journey and make this page better as I go.

## Usage

This page is designed for studying. Under each heading there are notes for each subject including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. You can overlook those notes and use them in whatever way benefits you.
You can also open the DevTools console if you are using Google Chrome by pressing Command+Option+I (MacOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows).
There you will see Javascript running and giving a random suggestion of what topic to study first. If you refresh the page it will randomize and select another topic!
